# Terraform-Bootcamp
Andrew Brown's Terraform for Bootcamp

So I'm going to be changing a few things about tools used in this bootcamp. I've only paid for the course and discord access.

## Tool changes
gitpod -> local vs code
class template -> this repo organized how I want

These changes aren't big but just wanted to not why there might be some differences.
